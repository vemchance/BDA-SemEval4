# Big Data Analytics SemEval2024 Entry

> Code for the [Big Data Analytics](https://bda-hull.github.io/) research group [SemEval2024 Task 4](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2024task4/index.html) entry.

This is our entry to [SemEval2024 Task 4: Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Memes](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2024task4/index.html). Our plan is to tackle only tasks **1** and **2a**.

**This repository is a work in progress.**

## System Requirements
- TODO detail system requirements here

## Getting started
TODO Write this section of the README. We should include:

- What is in each directory
- Where instructions are for each thing AND which is the main thing
- MAYBE getting started instructions for the main thing

## Contributing
TODO fill this out. I assume contributions are welcome after the challenge si finished. If so, we should say so here.

## Licence
TODO Decide on a licence. I **strongly** recommend an open-source licence.

I would recommend [AGPL-3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/), as it provides strong copyleft protections to ensure transparency on future and derivative works.

Apache2 (or MIT) is another alternative that is more permissive, but for research like this, this could reduce the transparency of derivative works.
