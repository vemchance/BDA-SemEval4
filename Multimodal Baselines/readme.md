# Multimodal Baselines
Notebooks for multimodal baselines, similar to unimodal.

Mostly boilerplate code and examples. Currently includes:

- Vision and Text Dual Encoder
- Basic Image and Text Ensemble (with modifications pending - works for binary and multiclass at the moment)

Pending models: UNITER and similar, ConcatBert (variation of the ensemble with gated multimodal layer).

Vision and Text Dual Encoder is problematic but code is available for anyone to work with. Dataloading, training loops .etc are relatively standard for PyTorch so should help as a good starting point. Ensemble model works fine for now although I forgot to change the accuracy loop for the multiclass.


## Model Files
Model files are too large to add to repository, stored on OneDrive link (PDF on main) under Multimodal Baselines. Pending upload.
