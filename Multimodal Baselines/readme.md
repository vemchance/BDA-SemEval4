# Multimodal Baselines
Notebooks for multimodal baselines, similar to unimodal.

Mostly boilerplate code and examples. Currently includes:

- Vision and Text Dual Encoder

Planning to include ensemble models, which are easier to work with. Also will include UNITER, CLIP, maybe a few others I can think of.

Vision and Text Dual Encoder is problematic but code is available for anyone to work with. Dataloading, training loops .etc are relatively standard for PyTorch so should help as a good starting point.


## Model Files
Model files are too large to add to repository, stored on OneDrive link (PDF on main) under Multimodal Baselines. Pending upload.
