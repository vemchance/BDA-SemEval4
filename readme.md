# EDA
This is where all the Exploratory Data Analysis will live. The first notebook is a quick overview of the data, mostly focusing on NLP but will be updated to include vision. Output images/files may also be placed here. Some more complex analysis might be added.

## To add:
- JRC helper notebook (JRC are the responisable org for the labels we're using)
- Entity analysis from GoogleVision
