# Unimodal Baselines

Jupyter Notebook file containing code to generate unimodal baselines fine-tuned on the subtask 1 dataset only. Note this is only for testing purposes; code is modified version of a SemEval 3 task and is for testing purposes only. Classes and functions can largely be reused to test and fine-tune on larger datasets.


## Data
Skip the first section of the notebook to read in the data, unless you want to modify and use your local files to fine-tune on different data. The actual CSV files used are available in testdata. Note the code currently requires the link (and subsuquent fields) are removed.

## Model Files
Model files are too large to add to repository, stored on OneDrive link (PDF on main) under Unimodal baselines.

### TO DO:
Requirements.txt file is missing, but you should be able to run the code and pip install from the imports.
Need to test on multilingual data.

Baselines not been tested - believe BERT uncased achieved around 62% accuracy on the validation set (not bad but small set)
